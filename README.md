REDCap TBS
==========
This REDCap plugin generates formatted reports for individual REDCap records. Using the Tiny But Strong  
PHP template engine, template files are written in HTML/CSS for layout and formatting. REDCap variables 
are replaced with their values for the specified record. REDCap projects can have multiple templates.

It relies on REDCap's bookmark feature to pass the project ID, record ID and the template file name to the plugin.


## Requirements
* REDcap version 5.6+ (not tested on earlier versions)
  * Bookmarks enabled
