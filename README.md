REDCap_TBS
==========

PHP template engine. The template files use HTML/CSS for layout and formatting. REDCap variables 
are replaced with their values for the specified record. REDCap projects can have multiple templates.

Relies on REDCap's bookmark feature to pass the project ID, record ID and the template file name to the plugin.
